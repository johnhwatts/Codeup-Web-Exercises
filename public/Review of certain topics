How do I even full stack?

server is a computer that's built to talk to computers

human -> browser -> asks server for stuff -> 
server -> figure out if/how to send stuff to the human -> browser in HTML/CSS/JS

front-end - stuff in the browser the user sees and interacts with (click links, submit forms)
		- HTML == "what you say" == content and structure
		- CSS =="how you say it" == styling and presentation
		- JS == "how we add interactivity" == how does the stuff in the browser get up and dance == "logic after the page loads"

back-end - server, file system, ways to store data, logic to check that data, logic before the page loads in the browser
		- Ubuntu linux == operating system for the server (operating systems 
		- PHP == logic language for programming server-side logic (logic before the page loads)
		- MySQL == database == place to store stuff and access it later

JSON == specially formatted text that follows very specific rules in order to declare data

ALL CODE IS JUST TEXT
